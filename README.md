# Traffic ML Models

My experiments on machine learning models (YOLOv5, CNN) on identifying traffic signs and traffic lights. Optimized for mobile and computationally limited devices. 

## Project structure

```
traffic_light_recognition
```
contains the ML model to identify traffic lights

```
traffic_sign_recognition
```
contains the ML model to identify traffic signs
